## 📚 What I Learned

### Python Fundamentals & Basic Concepts
- **Syntax & Code Structure:** Understanding indentation, code blocks, and writing clean code.
- **Variables & Data Types:** Mastering numbers, strings, booleans, and type conversions.
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators.

### Input/Output & File Handling
- **Basic I/O:** Using `print()` and `input()` functions.
- **File Operations:** Reading from and writing to text, CSV, and JSON files.

### Control Structures & Data Structures
- **Control Flow:** Implementing conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
- **Data Structures:**
  - **Lists & Tuples:** Creating, indexing, slicing, and manipulating sequences.
  - **Dictionaries & Sets:** Storing and retrieving key-value pairs and ensuring uniqueness.
- **Comprehensions:** Building lists, dictionaries, and sets using concise syntax.

### Functions, Modules, and Advanced Features
- **Functions:** Writing reusable code blocks, passing parameters, and returning values.
- **Lambda Functions:** Creating small anonymous functions.
- **Modules & Packages:** Importing libraries and organizing code for reusability.
- **Decorators & Generators:** Enhancing functions and creating efficient iterators.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes & Objects:** Designing blueprints for custom data types.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Creating hierarchies to extend and customize functionality.
- **Special Methods:** Leveraging dunder methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`) for better integration.

### Error Handling & Debugging
- **Exception Handling:** Using try-except blocks to manage errors gracefully.
- **Debugging Techniques:** Tools and practices to identify and fix bugs effectively.

### Advanced Topics & Additional Tools
- **Iterators & Generators:** Understanding lazy evaluation and creating efficient data pipelines.
- **Regular Expressions:** Pattern matching and text processing for advanced string manipulation.
- **Web Scraping:** Using libraries like BeautifulSoup to extract and process data from the web.

### Data Science & Machine Learning (Optional / As Applicable)
- **NumPy & Pandas:** Working with arrays, data frames, and performing data manipulation.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating plots and charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Introductory ML Concepts:** Basic algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.
